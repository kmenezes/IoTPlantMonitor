          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            By the year 2050, the worldâ€™s population could exceed 10 billion.
            Feeding that population means a substantial increase in food
            production and a push for a more sustainable farming infrastructure.
            The essence of Precision Agriculture is to provide a sensor platform
            connected to the cloud combined with aerial/satellite imagery to
            enable data analytics for farmers/decision makers to help reduce the
            amount of resources (water/nutrients) required. The IOT Plan Monitor
            is a basic demonstration of sensor data that can be obtained and
            reported remotely to a server. Combining historical data with
            machine learning techniques the IOT Plant Monitor could
            revolutionize the future of agriculture and take a giant leap
            forward in tackling world hunger.

          <h3>Sensors</h3>
          <p>
            The IOT Plant monitor utilizes two basic Sensors (but is scalable to
            more to cover acres of land):
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>1.Soil Temperature Sensor (XCSOURCE 5PCS Temperature Sensor DS18B20, $15.99 from Amazon)</p>
          <br />
          <p>2.Soil Moisture Sernsor (Kuman 5PCS Soil Moisture Sensor Kit, $8.99 from Amazon)</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These sensors are common in agriculture to track how farmers utilize
            their resources (water, fertilizers, nutrients) which affects yeild
            and profit margins later on. The total cost was around $28 and was programmed with Python.
          </p>
          <h4>Design Development Plan</h4>
          <br />
          <img src="img/ddp.jpg" alt="Design Development Plan"/>
          <p>
            The design development plan followed to was define functional
            requirements, to find what functionality the system would need.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. From there we made a trade study to find different sensors on the
            market and their related cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. With the sensors in-house we could rapid prototype obtaining the
            prototype and developing the front-end UI. Here is a video
            demonstrating the basic functionality of the design
          </p>

          <h5>Final Product</h5>
          <p>
            The final product ran the main.py script through Putty and displayed
            the output over the terminal
